OBJECTIVE:

This program will allow the user to play hangman against the computer using a list of words from a txt file.
-Function that randomly selects a word from the text dictionary
-fuction that takes input from the user which will be the letter guest 
-Function that will take the letters guessed correctly and turn them into a string 
-need to create various variables to store the users inputted data
  -variable for the word that the computer picks 
  -create a set of data that holds the letters guessed wrong and the letters guessed right by the user
-We need to display an intro to the program 
-Build a repetitive system, so that user can keep guessing letters
-If the user guesses wrong, a new part of the body is drawn, until they lose. (Guesses left goes down/wrong guesses goes up) 
-add statements at the end and beginning that welcome and thank the user for playing
